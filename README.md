## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Leo, just an ordinary guy with a knack for tech tinkering
- I'm into the internet, traveling, reading, and listening to music â€“ still figuring out this whole "living life" thing.
- I've got a British Shorthair cat, a hefty 8-kilo furball named Liangzai(cool guy in Cantonese). He's mean, mischievous, but undeniably handsome.
